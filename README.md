A customizable social platform designed to foster authentic communities in the crypto space, emphasizing meaningful, trust-based relationships.

## What We Integrated Flow With

This project leverages blockchain technology to manage two key aspects:

1. **Subscription Services**: We've deployed a smart contract that handles subscription management, allowing users to subscribe to content or services within the platform. Payments and subscription duration are securely handled through blockchain transactions, ensuring transparency and immutability.
   
2. **User Profile Metrics**: Another set of smart contracts track and store user-specific metrics like follower count, reputation score, and ranking information. The blockchain ensures that this data is verified, secure, and decentralized.

These integrations on Flow testnet allow the platform to combine the benefits of blockchain technology—such as security, transparency, and decentralized verification—with a social platform's community engagement features.
